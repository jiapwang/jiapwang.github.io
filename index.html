				<p class = "bold">Design and Implementation 1</p>
				<p><span class = "bold">Pong: </span> Created a two-player game using Java in Eclipse. The objective of the game was to get the opponent's life count to zero. The game consisted of two paddles and a ball. With each contact with the paddle, the ball increased in speed. A player loses one life if they miss returning the ball. Upon losing a life the ball respawns on the respective side of the window. When one of the players' life count reached zero, a window popped up announcing and congratulating the winner.</p><br>

				<p class = "bold">Object Oriented Programming</p>
				<p><span class = "bold">Bot Trust: </span>Created a simulation using Java in Eclipse. The simulation consisted of two circles representing a blue and orange robot and one hundred squares representing the buttons the robots may need to push. As the simulation progressed, the robots, the buttons, the actions of the robots, and the time were drawn onto the screen.</p>
